### Hi, I'm Larry. ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ˜Š I started coding since I was a 16 years old, and now I'm completely settled in the Javascript language.

ğŸ“š While making [my own web service](https://mo-gak-ko.xyz), I was able to experience the whole web's operation in person.

ğŸ§¡ I'm into Javascript and Typescript, React, Node.js, GraphQL.
