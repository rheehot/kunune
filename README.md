### Hi, I'm Larry. 👋

😊 I started coding since I was a 16 years old, and now I'm completely settled in the Javascript language.

📚 While making [my own web service](https://mo-gak-ko.xyz), I was able to experience the whole web's operation in person.
> Related keywards : Domain, NS, DNS Record, A-type, Cloud VM, Linux, Process management, API...

🧡 I'm into Javascript and Typescript, React, Node.js, GraphQL.
